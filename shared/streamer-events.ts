 * The `/api/ashketchum` wire contract between brobot and the streamer client.
 *
 * The rebuilt client (ticket C1, apps/brobot-client) imports this file BY
 * COPY: it must stay self-contained — no imports, no runtime dependencies —
 * and a change here is a change to that copy too.
 *
 * Transport: one WebSocket at `wss://<api host>/api/ashketchum`. The upgrade
 * carries `WS_SECRET`, as `Authorization: Bearer <secret>` (or, for the 2022
 * client, a `token: <secret>` header); anything else is refused with HTTP 401
 * before a socket exists. Every frame is one JSON object with a `type`.
 * Unknown types are ignored by both sides, so either can add one first.
 *
 * The 2022 client spoke Nest's `{ event, data }` frames; this contract
 * replaces them.
